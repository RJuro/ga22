Framework Programs and International Copublication
Özgür Kadir Özer, METU

How do FP programs alter co-publication activity?
How is that mediated by various proximity dimensions?
You do what you promise. but is it enough?
Evaluation paper? Theory contribution? Purely empirical excercise?

Lacks motivation and theoretical framing beyond proximity-taxonomy (Boschma), no clear statement of audience (we know it's mainly other academics)

Intro reads a bit as a literature review and consider moving it into theory part

I missed:
Role of serendipity
Is it good to publish across just for the sake of it? 
Political arguments?
Subject-motivation: Need to access expertise of specific labs.
Co-publishing needs to be contextualized: e.g. Copenhagen Univ. collaboration with China: SSH publications with few autors on a paper are a tiny fraction of the overall collaboration. The main part are large wet sciences projects with 50+ autors on publications - "big science". Very different from a 3 autors-paper in innovation studies where serendipity plays a big role.
Is country-level a useful level of aggregation?

Discussion about time delays

Relational / Network-based indicators: You do not need them but they would be useful and provide more nuance perhaps. e.g. aggregates og bibliographic coupling or projections of journal co-publication.

Is co-publication interesting as a dependent? Perhaps look into complexity dynamics.


Pursuing a mission. How a research and technology organisation translates a social challenge into a scientific mission - the case of EMBRAPA
Arthur Gomes Moreira, SPRU

Alignment of the research institution with policy ambitions / missions.
Time-interval topic modeling of research output of EMBRAPA. 
Qualitative interpretation of results.

Well executed LDA based TM.
Result: They do various relevant things...

Ambition of the paper is to look at missions and translation of social challenges into scientific missions. 
Environmental points are made in the intro but not really followed up.

Unclear if it's an evaluation paper or policy informing in other ways? What is the theoretical question and how is it operationalised?
Questions of agency. Who decides what's researched?

For me the real question here is: How to reach alignment (also wrt incentives) and who decides?
More of the results should go into the appendix. Right now a bit too report-like.

Visualization over time very crowded. Consider punsh-card plot.
Compliment with more traditional bibliometric analysis. Co-publication for instance.

Patent data? Results of the research --> Translation into technology. Non-patent-citations to the research outputs.

Researcher-level analysis: Applied vs. basic?

NLP may need "robustness" checks - clustering is at times unstable.
